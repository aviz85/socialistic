# Socialistic Test Plan

## Executive Summary

The Socialistic platform test suite currently has **147 passing tests** (85% pass rate) with 24 skipped tests and 1 warning. The test suite covers the core functionality of the platform including user management, posts, comments, projects, notifications, security, and performance.

| Notifications | 18 | 2 | 20 | 90% |
| Posts | 30 | 7 | 37 | 81% |
| Projects | 17 | 6 | 23 | 74% |
| Users | 13 | 4 | 17 | 76% |
| Integration | 11 | 1 | 12 | 92% |
| Performance | 4 | 1 | 5 | 80% |
| **TOTAL** | **147** | **24** | **171** | **85%** |

## Recent Fixes

### Model Improvements
1. **Field Name Standardization**:
   - Notification Model: Changed `notification_type` → `type` and `read` → `is_read`
   - Ensured consistent naming patterns across all models

2. **Validation Methods**:
   - Post Model: Added proper validation to ensure either content or code snippet is present
   - Comment Model: Added validation to require content
   - All validation methods now raise appropriate ValidationError exceptions

3. **String Representation**:
   - Post: `"Post by {username}: {content[:30]}"`
   - Comment: `"Comment by {username} on post {post.id}: {content[:30]}"`
   - PostLike: `"{username} likes post {post.id}"`
   - Fixed all tests to align with these representations

### API Improvements
1. **URL Pattern Consistency**:
   - Standardized URL names: `post-list` instead of `post-list-create`
   - Added missing endpoints:
     - `post-unlike` for unliking posts
     - `post-comments` for post comments
     - `notification-mark-all-read` for bulk notification actions

2. **API Response Structure**:
   - Enhanced serializers to return consistent response formats
   - Fixed pagination structure in collection endpoints
   - Improved error handling for client-friendly messages

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Fixed notification creation in integration tests
   - Properly handling content types and generic relations
   - Improved GenericForeignKey usage for notifications

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 85% of code paths covered by tests
- **Test Isolation**: 98% of tests pass when run individually
- **Test Speed**: Average 0.15s per test
- **Integration Coverage**: All critical user journeys covered
- **Security Depth**: Authentication, authorization and data isolation verified

## Skipped Tests Analysis

| Feature | # Tests | Implementation Priority |
|---------|---------|-------------------------|
| User search endpoint | 3 | Medium |
| Comment detail endpoints | 4 | High |
| Comment like endpoints | 5 | Medium |
| Project tech stack endpoints | 4 | Low |
| Project collaborator removal | 2 | High |
| User skills endpoints | 6 | Medium |

## Known Issues

1. **CollaborationRequest Queryset Warning**:
   - Unordered object list in queryset causing inconsistent pagination
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Solution**: Implement explicit ordering in the queryset

2. **Ordering for Followers/Following Lists**:
   - No consistent ordering for user relationship lists
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Solution**: Add default ordering in model Meta class

## Action Plan

### Short-term (1-2 Weeks)
1. Implement high priority skipped features:
   - Comment detail endpoints
   - Project collaborator removal endpoints
   - Target: Reduce skipped tests from 24 to 14

2. Fix queryset ordering issues:
   - Add explicit ordering to collaboration request querysets
   - Add default ordering for followers/following lists

3. Improve test documentation:
   - Add docstrings to all test classes
   - Document test fixtures and factory methods

### Medium-term (3-4 Weeks)
1. Implement medium priority skipped features:
   - User search endpoint
   - Comment like endpoints
   - User skills endpoints
   - Target: Reduce skipped tests from 14 to 5

2. Enhance API tests:
   - Add more edge cases and error conditions
   - Test pagination with large datasets
   - Add tests for proper error messages and codes

3. Implement performance improvements:
   - Optimize database queries in list endpoints
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data

### Long-term (5+ Weeks)
1. Complete remaining skipped features:
   - Project tech stack endpoints
   - Target: Zero skipped tests

2. Reach 90%+ test coverage:
   - Add more integration and unit tests
   - Focus on error handling paths
   - Test client-side validation and server responses

3. Implement extended tests:
   - Load testing with realistic user volumes
   - Scalability testing for notification delivery
   - End-to-end testing with frontend components
